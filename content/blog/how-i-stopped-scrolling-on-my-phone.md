The most popular apps and websites are designed to hook you like a drug. I had struggled for years with internet addiction, but finally feel free.

Here’s what worked for me:

## Step 1: Go to a Therapist

This was both the most important step. Being able to talk about my addiction with someone who could hold me accountable helped me fight back in a real way. Finding the right therapist was tough, but worth it.

## Step 2: Use Android and the Minimalist Launcher.

I was already an Android user, but because of that, I was able to use this app launcher to help cut down on the stimulation from my phone.

It makes using your phone just a little more inconveinent. The bright colors and app widgets that I used to subconciously associate with instant gratification vanished. In there place, I have to manually search for whatever app I want to use.

It is paid, but it’s worth the price. It will be useful in the following steps too.

## Step 3: Deconstructing my Phone Usage

I used my phone for a lot of things before.

It’s the ultimate digital multi tool, but the more I keep it in my hands, the more likely I am to subconciously use it or open it.

I realized my goal should be to keep it closed (but ready if I need it).

This realization lead to new questions: How many devices does my phone replace? And what functions should truly be handled by my phone?

Here’s what I came up with:

1. Phone - (calls, texts, messaging, emails)
2. Phone - (travel, gps, photos)
3. Phone - (passwords and auth)
4. Watch - (what time is it, timers, alarms)
5. Notebook & Pen - (todo lists)
6. MP3 player - (music)
7. Switch / Handheld (mobile gaming)
8. TV - (streaming video and sports)
9. Computer - (everything else)

Deciding which physical interface to use for each task helped me realize, I don’t need to use my phone for everything. So I bought some of these items to replace parts of my phone.

## Step 4: Deleting Apps

Changing interfaces meant a lot of unused apps.

So I deleted half the apps on my phone. All the games, music, podcasts, sports, news, job boards, shopping, social media accounts, streaming video, and even my beloved Firefox, all of it was deleted.

The point is: go nuclear.

Getting rid of unnecessary apps means you will use your phone less often. I will still use those services, just on different devices.

## Step 5: Setting App Usage

After I removed the apps that could distract me unnecesarily, it was time to limit the essential apps that I couldn’t delete.

For me, there were two I needed to keep, with limits:

- Chrome
- BlueSky

I need Chrome just in case I have to view an online menu or tutorial video to fix my dishwasher. But I don’t need unfettered access all day and night. That freedom was actually a curse.

Bluesky is a new social media site for me, and I’m trying to engage regularly, so I want those notifications. But just like Google and Reddit and Twitter, I don’t want to spend all night browsing.

So for each of these apps, I setup a max daily time limit (30 min) through Android’s digital wellness menu.

The minimalist launcher also allowed me to set “Blocking Schedules” to prevent me from using those two highly addictive apps from 8 PM to 7 AM. That has been a complete gamechanger.

The effect is that I don’t waste my time on either app.

I get in, and get out quickly, to preserve my daily time balance, and at night, when I’m most prone to distraction, I’m protected.

## Step 6: New Rules and Behaviors

I’d rather not have unfettered access to the internet follow me around inside my pocket all day. I hate how doomscrolling made me feel.

I needed healthy browsing habits, and I found them through self-reflection.

For me, healthy means when I’m on a desktop computer, I can browse with no time limit. I love learning and researching. But on a phone, I need the limits to keep me from doomscrolling.

### Music

I am also using Plex now, instead of Spotify and Pandora. Self hosted media is infinitely more satisfying than being just a user, and the lack of ads is honestly amazing.

### News

I’m using Feeder (RSS) on my phone for reading the occassional article. It is calmingly non-addictive, in my opinion, because every article looks the same (font, colors, layout, etc).

## Conclusion

I am now extremely satisfied with how I use my phone.

I use it to do good things, like texting, writing, and adding music to real life. I don’t waste hours doomscrolling on it anymore.

I’m glad I don’t have a tablet or laptop, otherwise this might not be so effective. And my Roku TV with YouTube is trying to claw back some of my time. But that’s okay, because one day, I might figure out a way to limit Roku apps too.
